## What is this?
This is a game! or a set of games!
More or less i want this to be an online game that people can play to test their breadth of knowledge of the English language, at least in terms of vocabulary.
This game will allow people to sign up as to track their progress. 
There will be more than one game mode(s) and a mode for parsing the english dictionary via a dynamic graph.
This project will be done purely with python, javascript, and a bit of html + css.
I will use Docker Compose to run several containers concurrently each with its own role to play in the system to start off; if traffic picks up, i will start considering cloud computing like AWS or Azure.
The following outlines the system's bare minimum nodes ( while locally run ):
* server
* db
* worker ( for parsing web; populating db )
* some sort of load balancer

## Why should I care?
This project is fun!
It should be engaging enough on its own.
The only requirement is a curious mind.
By signing up, you will be able to track your progress, see new words you may have never encountered, and extend your everyday vocabulary!

## How do I get started?
Simply find the website, either login/signup or play as a guest ( guest won't track your progress ) and choose a game mode. Then just play!

## Where can I find more help? 
There is an about page that goes over the idea behind the game, the inspiration, a bit about me the author / designer, and other cool tidbits about the English language.
